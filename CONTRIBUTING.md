# Contributing guidelines
Hi there! If you are reading this document, you might be wondering about contribution to GooCord.
First, I'm very glad that you are wondering!

GooCord is a relatively big project. However, we are trying to keep it as simple as possible.
Thus, here goes the rule number one - keep it simple.

Secondly, follow naming conventions. They are usually pretty straightforward to catch up. At least, try to name
things as closely to Discord's naming as possible. Also, name everything as close to its meaning as possible.

And the last one - follow commit style. We don't force you to use stuff like conventional commits
or stuff. Just say what your commit does to the code base and, if needed, add issue in parentheses in the end.

Happy coding!
